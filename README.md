# Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. The system aims to enhance road safety by continuously monitoring the driver's alertness and detecting signs of drowsiness such as eye closure and yawning.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Utilizes the YOLO object detection framework for fast and accurate real-time detection.
- **High Precision and Recall**: Achieved high precision (0.92) and recall (0.88) in detecting drowsiness indicators.
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Analyzes facial features to identify signs of drowsiness.
- **Custom Model**: Customized YOLO model for effective detection of drowsy states in drivers.
- **Team Collaboration**: Developed in collaboration with a team of four, demonstrating strong teamwork and project management skills.

## Implementation Details

### Dataset Preparation

1. **Data Collection**: Collected a diverse set of images depicting various states of alertness and drowsiness in drivers.
2. **Annotation**: Annotated the collected data to label drowsiness indicators.
3. **Preprocessing**: Preprocessed the dataset to ensure it is suitable for training the YOLO model.

### Model Training

1. **Model Selection**: Selected the YOLOv5 object detection framework due to its speed and accuracy in real-time applications.
2. **Customization**: Customized the YOLOv5 model to detect specific drowsiness indicators.
3. **Training**: Trained the model on the prepared dataset, optimizing for high precision and recall.

### Detection and Alert System

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Implemented real-time monitoring of the driver's facial features and posture.
2. **Alert Mechanism**: Developed an alert system to notify the driver when drowsiness indicators are detected.

## Results

- **Precision**: 0.92
- **Recall**: 0.88

The system demonstrates high accuracy in detecting drowsiness, contributing to improved road safety by alerting drivers to take necessary actions when signs of drowsiness are detected.
